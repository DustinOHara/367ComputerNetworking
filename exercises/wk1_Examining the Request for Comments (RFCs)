## Examining the Request for Comments (RFCs)

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) maintains a list of Request for Comments (RFCs) that document the development of internet standards, starting in 1969. These RFCs represent correspondences among researchers that serve a variety of purposes. As a way to help organize them, each RFC is given a status that describes the nature of its contents. 

A description of all statuses can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments#Status (Links to an external site.)

Some RFCs contain proposals of new functionality or solutions to known issues. Others contain surveys and measurements that document a snapshot in internet technology and its use. The RFCs that we will investigate in this exercise are RFCs that define protocol standards. These are RFCs that are given a status of “Internet Standard”.

A complete catalog of all RFCs can be found here: https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/index (Links to an external site.).

Using the resources above, answer the following questions. You may draw on information from other resources. Please include a list of any additional sources you use.

1. What is the earliest RFC with the status “Internet Standard”? Briefly (1-2 paragraphs) describe its contents. Be sure to include its contributions, limitations, and relevance today.

2. View RFC#2616. Briefly (1-2 paragraphs) describe its contents. Be sure to include its contributions, limitations, and relevance today.
